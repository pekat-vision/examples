# PEKAT VISION 
[PEKAT VISION](https://www.pekatvision.com/) is a software for industrial visual inspection and quality assurance based on AI.

It is able to check products or input raw materials which have an unstable look or shape.

It uses its own proprietary __focused-learning__ algorithm which goes beyond deep-learning.

Focused-learning works __like a human eye__. It is able to __focus on detail__ and needs only __a few__ images for learning and understanding the task.

Even from the few images it is able to recognize when an object or material is defect-free and when it is defective.

It can find __anomalies__, detect and classify __defects__ and check __surface__ on materials and objects where current vision systems fail.
